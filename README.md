# Simple Spotify Playlist Creator

Implement a simple Spotify Playlist Creator in React + Typescript without using any libraries (other than React)

## Minimum requirements

- Must use Typescript.
- Must use Spotify’s public API.
- There should be a login screen.
- Once logged in, there should be a screen where you can see the current song you are playing on Spotify (The app) - We will judge the amount of info/design choices you make on this screen.
- There needs to be a button to add the song to a playlist on the current playing screen, and the user should be able to add a name to the playlist or select from a list of created playlists.
    NOTE: We prefer you to create the playlists without using Spotify’s API (see bonus points). But bear in mind that the playlists need to be persisted for future uses.
- There should be a screen that shows the list of playlists.
- When a user clicks on one of the playlists, show the list of songs.

## Bonus points

- Can remove songs from playlists.
- Can remove playlists.
- Don’t use Spotify’s API for playlists :)

## Notes

- The code should be clean and/or well-documented.
- The evaluation criteria will consider:
    - Code quality
    - Deep understanding of React concepts and features
    - UI/UX
